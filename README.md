GET SONG LYRICS

This is an application that allows you to search for lyrics to any song by typing in an artist
followed by a song from that artist.
This application uses bootstrap for the layout and modal functionality and uses a heavy reliance on
JavaScript to dynamically create "song containers" to hold the fetched data from the "https://api.lyrics.ovh/v1/"
api. This application uses promises and fetch in order to grab the data from this api.
